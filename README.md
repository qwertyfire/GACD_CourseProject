**Required Library**
* dplyr : http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/index.html</li>

**Assumptions**
* This script uses the *Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set*, and assumes that is the dataset it will be used on. Information about this dataset can be found here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

**Instructions**
1. Download dataset from here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 1
2. Unzip the file and move the 'UCI HAR Dataset' folder to your working directory. 2
3. Place the run_analysis.R file in the same working directory. (i.e. not in the 'UCI HAR Dataset' folder but the same directory as it)3
4. Running the run_analysis.R file will output a TidyData.txt file in that directory. 

##Codebook.md
This file contains descriptions about variables in the Tidy Dataset created by the run_analysis.R script.
