##This repo contains the following files: 
* run_analysis.R
* Codebook.md

##run_analysis.R
**Required Library**
* dplyr : http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/index.html</li>

**Assumptions**
* This script uses the *Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set*, and assumes that is the dataset it will be used on. Information about this dataset can be found here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

**Instructions**
* Download dataset from here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
* Unzip the file and move the 'UCI HAR Dataset' folder to your working directory. 
* Place the run_analysis.R file in the same working directory. (i.e. not in the 'UCI HAR Dataset' folder but the same directory as it)
* Running the run_analysis.R file will output a TidyData.txt file in that directory. 

##Codebook.md
This file contains descriptions about variables in the Tidy Dataset created by the run_analysis.R script. 
**Assumptions**
*The codebook assumes you are familiar with *Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set*. Specifically that you have read and understand the documentation files that come with the downloaded dataset.
